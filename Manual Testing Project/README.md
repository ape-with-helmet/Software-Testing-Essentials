## Project Introduction
We will be testing an **e-commerce** product/Application.  
You as a customer should be able to do the following:
- Login
- Search for products/items
- Add them to cart
- Do payment
- Product should be delivered
- Return product etc.

For any **e-commerce** project, there will be 2 parts:
1. **Front-end:** The part of the project which is visible to the public and is the interface through which the user interacts. Since this can be accessed across organizations, it is called an *Internet Application*.
2. **Back-end:** The part of the project which is available only to the admin in their environment. Customer cannot access this part of this project. Since this can be accessed only within the organization, it is called an *Intranet Application*.

As part of our project, we will be working with only the frontend.  
The product we will be testing for our project is [Open Cart](https://demo.opencart.com/).

## Understanding & Explore the Functionality
Since usually we never get the application in hand before creating the test plan, we must rely on documents like **FRS documents** to create our test plan.  
Check out the [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/vv2PskqvGRA?list=PLUDwpEzHYYLseflPNg0bUKfLmAbO2JnE9&t=1450) to actually view the frs document. The document will contain all the functional requirements, may contain some mock up screens to show how the product should look like. Highlight the requirements on this document as we will be using this to write our test cases. We do estimation also at this point in time.
