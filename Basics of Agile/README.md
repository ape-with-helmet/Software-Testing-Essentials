## Agile model/ Agile methodology/ Agile process
Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.
The process of Requirement collection, design, coding, testing and deployment is repeated again and again. We add small amount of features to the existing product over iterations.
### Principles of Agile
- The customer should not have to wait until the entire software is complete. 
- The development team delivers small portions of the software after developing and testing them while the customer is using the software.
- We should be able to accomodate requirement changes easily.

There will be good communication between the Customer, Business Analyst, Developers and Testers.

### Advantages
- Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development (or) We can accomodate requirement changes in the middle of development.
- Releases will be very fast (Weekly).
- Customer need not wait for a long time.
- Good communication between team.
- It is a very easy model to adopt.

### Disadvantages
There is less focus on design and documentation since we deliver the software very fast.

## Scrum
Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following Agile Principles.

Scrum includes a group of people called as scrum team. Normally consists of 5-9 members.
- Product Owner (PO)
- Scrum Master (SM)
- Developer Team (Dev)
- Tester team (QA)

### Product Owner

- Prioritize features according to market value
- Adjust features and priority in every iteration as needed
- Accept or reject work results.

### Scrum Master
